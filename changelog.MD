------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
examples of patches include: "US skyrim 1.09" & "US skyrim 1.08" & "US fallout 4 1.22", others are coming soon, if you want to help speed up the process send me the eboot.bin of older fallout 4 updates(1.21, 1.20, etc)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added support for EU version of skyrim 1.09
- this will only work for the raw version of the eboot.bin not the extracted version, if you want to make the extracted version work you need to edit it a bit, if you are going to be doing the extracted eboot.bin you need to remove these byts in HxD
remove all bytes prioir to .elf.
